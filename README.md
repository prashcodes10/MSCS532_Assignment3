# MSCS532_Assignment3
This project helps to develop the skills necessary to evaluate algorithm performance, implement efficient solutions, and make informed decisions about algorithm selection based on theoretical and empirical analysis.

## Files
- 'hashchain.py' : Python implementation of hash table using chaining for collusion resolutions. 
- 'Assignment 3.pdf' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, and comparisons of Randomized Quicksort, and Hashing with Chaining. 
- 'quicksort.py' : Python implementation of randomized quicksort and its analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: https://github.com/prashcodes10/MSCS532_Assignment3
2. Make sure python is already installed in the system. 
3. Run the code using the command: python.\hashchain.py OR python.\quicksort.py

## Summary
This project highlights the effectiveness of randomized quicksort and hashing with chaining.
